        <b>Global Scope -</b> A variable declared at the top of a program or
        outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.

        <b>Block Scope -</b> Block scope is defined with curly braces. It is
        separated by { and }. Variables declared with let and const can have
        block scope. They can only be accessed in the block in which they are
        defined.

        <b>Event loop -</b> An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of
        the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the
        function stack becomes empty.The event loop is the secret by which
        JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is
        single-threaded.
